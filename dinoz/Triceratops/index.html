    <h1>Triceratops</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Triceratops
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Triceratops lived in North America during the late Cretaceous period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a herbivorous dinosaur that primarily fed on low-growing vegetation, such as ferns and shrubs.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Triceratops is known for its three horns, with one on its snout and two larger ones above its eyes.
      The three horns of a Triceratops could reach lengths of up to 3 feet (1 meter) and were used for defense against predators.
      Triceratops had a massive skull, which accounted for about one-third of its total body length.
      This dinosaur had a bony frill at the back of its head, which likely served as a display structure and may have helped regulate body temperature.
      Triceratops is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs and is often depicted in popular culture.</p>
