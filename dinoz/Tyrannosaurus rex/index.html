    <h1>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Tyrannosaurus Rex
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in North America during the late Cretaceous period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and other animals.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Tyrannosaurus Rex had one of the most powerful bites in history, capable of exerting a force of over 12,800 pounds (5,760 kg).
      Its teeth were around 6 inches (15 cm) long and serrated, designed to tear through flesh and bone.
      Tyrannosaurus Rex had a large head and a muscular, robust body, with powerful hind limbs for chasing and capturing prey.
      This dinosaur had tiny arms relative to its body size, with only two fingers on each hand.
      Recent studies suggest that Tyrannosaurus Rex may have been covered in feathers or proto-feathers when it was young.</p>
