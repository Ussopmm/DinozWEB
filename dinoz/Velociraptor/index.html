    <h1>Velociraptors</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Velociraptors
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Velociraptor lived in Mongolia and China during the late Cretaceous period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that hunted small- to medium-sized animals, including other dinosaurs.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Velociraptor was a fast and agile dinosaur, with a long, slender body and a long, stiff tail for balance.
      It had sharp, curved claws on its hind feet, which were likely used to latch onto prey and deliver fatal kicks.
      Velociraptor is often depicted as being covered in feathers, supported by fossil evidence of feather-like structures in closely related species.
      This dinosaur had a large sickle-shaped claw on each foot, possibly used for slashing and disemboweling prey.
      Velociraptor had a relatively large brain compared to other dinosaurs, suggesting a higher level of intelligence and complex social behaviors.</p>
