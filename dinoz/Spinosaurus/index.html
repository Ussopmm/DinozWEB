    <h1>Spinosaurus</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Spinosaurus
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Spinosaurus lived in North Africa during the Cretaceous period, and its habitat included both land and water environments.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that had a varied diet, including fish and other aquatic animals.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Spinosaurus is thought to be one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs, potentially reaching lengths of up to 49 feet (15 meters).
      It had a sail-like structure on its back, which may have played a role in thermoregulation or display.
      Spinosaurus had a long snout filled with conical teeth, ideal for catching slippery prey like fish.
      This dinosaur had adaptations for a partially aquatic lifestyle, including paddle-like feet and dense bones for buoyancy.
      Recent research suggests that Spinosaurus may have been more adept at swimming than previously believed, potentially even hunting in water.</p>
