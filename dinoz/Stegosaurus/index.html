    <h1>Stegosaurus</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Allosaurus
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Stegosaurus lived in North America during the late Jurassic period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a herbivorous dinosaur that fed on low-lying vegetation such as ferns, mosses, and cycads.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Stegosaurus is characterized by its distinctive rows of upright plates along its back and four spikes on its tail.
      The purpose of Stegosaurus' plates is still debated, with theories ranging from thermoregulation to display for mating.
      It had a relatively small brain compared to its body size, about the size of a walnut.
      Stegosaurus had a slow metabolism, and recent research suggests it may have been able to elevate its body temperature to digest plant matter more efficiently.
      This dinosaur had a low-slung body and a relatively small head, making it well-suited for browsing on low-lying vegetation.</p>
