        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Carnotaurus lived in South America during the late Cretaceous period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that primarily hunted other dinosaurs and smaller animals.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Carnotaurus had a distinctive appearance, with a bull-like build, short arms, and horns above its eyes.
      It had one of the smallest forelimbs of any known theropod dinosaur, with arms that were reduced in size and functionally useless.
      This dinosaur is known for its unusual sprinting ability, with a body built for quick bursts of speed.
      Carnotaurus had a powerful bite force, aided by sharp teeth and robust jaw muscles.
      Its name, Carnotaurus, means "meat-eating bull" in reference to its physical characteristics.</p>
