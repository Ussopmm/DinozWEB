    <h1>Allosaurus</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Allosaurus
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Allosaurus inhabited North America during the late Jurassic period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that primarily preyed on herbivorous dinosaurs and other smaller animals.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:
        Allosaurus was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, reaching lengths of up to 39 feet (12 meters).
        It had sharp, serrated teeth designed for cutting through flesh and tearing meat.
        Allosaurus likely hunted in packs, exhibiting cooperative behavior during the hunt.
        It had strong hind limbs and a flexible neck, allowing for swift movement and agile attacks.
        Allosaurus may have engaged in cannibalism, as bite marks on some fossils indicate attacks by other Allosaurus individuals.</p>
