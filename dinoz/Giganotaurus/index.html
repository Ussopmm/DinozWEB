    <h1>Giganotosaurus</h1>
    <p>    Dinosaur species: Giganotosaurus
        
        
        </p>
    <p>Habitat: Giganotosaurus lived in South America during the late Cretaceous period.</p>
    <p>Diet: It was a carnivorous dinosaur that preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and other animals.</p>
    <p>5 Interesting Facts:

      Giganotosaurus is one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs, potentially reaching lengths of up to 43 feet (13 meters).
      It had sharp, serrated teeth similar to those of T. rex, designed for gripping and tearing flesh.
      Giganotosaurus had long, powerful hind limbs that allowed it to achieve high speeds while chasing its prey.
      This dinosaur had a relatively small brain compared to its body size.
      Giganotosaurus likely had a complex social structure, as suggested by fossilized trackways showing groups of individuals moving together.</p>
